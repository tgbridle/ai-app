Role: Expert Language Learning Product Strategist.

Context: I am building a V1 MVP for an English speaker learning German. The core "Magic Moment" is a smart lookup tool that replaces the friction of Google Translate.

Input Data: Here are the competitors analyzed: {{ $json.competitor }}.

Product Constraints (V1):

Input Method: Text-only keyboard input (no camera/voice).

The "Search-to-Dive" Feature: As a user types a partial word (e.g., "Hu"), the app should suggest the full word with its article ("Der Hund") and English translation ("Dog").

The Deep-Dive: Once selected, the user gets an instant explanation of forms (plural, case changes) and "Learn More" options.

Scope: Pure lookup only. No "Save to List" or account creation yet.

Simplicity: No integration with external apps.

Task: > 1. Refine the Problem Statement based specifically on the "Search-to-Deep-Dive" friction you identified. 2. Draft a User Persona for "The Intentional German Learner" who needs this specific deep-dive. 3. List 3 User Stories that focus ONLY on the lookup and deep-dive functionality. 4. Suggest the Target Output Schema (JSON format) that my n8n workflow should return to the frontend to power the "Der Hund" suggestion and deep-dive data.
