## 2) User Persona — “The Intentional German Learner”

**Name:** Alex (32)  
**Background:** Native English speaker, B1-ish German, learning for career + life (partner/friends in Germany, travel, or job). Not a “gamified streak” learner; prefers clarity and correctness.  
**Primary contexts of use:** Reading articles, emails, subtitles, graded readers; writing short messages; looking up words mid-flow.

**Goals**
- Understand *not just meaning*, but **how to correctly use the word in sentences**.
- Build reliable mental models: gender, plural, cases, common patterns.
- Reduce lookup time so reading/writing remains enjoyable.

**Behaviors**
- Types what they remember (“Hu…”, “Hund…”) or what they saw (“Hunde”, “Hundes”, “dem Hund”).
- Wants immediate confirmation of **article + meaning** before committing attention.
- When confused by endings, wants a **quick, structured explanation**, not a long grammar lesson.

**Pain Points with current tools**
- Google Translate/DeepL: good meaning, weak on **gender + declension clarity** and “why this form”.
- Dictionaries: good info but slower to navigate; type-ahead often doesn’t prioritize “learner-ready” display (article+translation).
- Context tools: too much text; hard to extract the inflection rules quickly.

**Success moment (Magic Moment)**
Alex types **“Hu”**, immediately sees **“der Hund — dog”**, taps it, and instantly understands:  
plural **Hunde**, genitive **des Hundes**, dative **dem Hund**, accusative **den Hund**—plus a short explanation of what changed and why.
