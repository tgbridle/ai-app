English-speaking learners of German repeatedly hit a **two-step friction loop**:

1) **Search friction:** When they type a partial German word (or an inflected form they saw in the wild), existing tools often require a full/accurate query and return results that are:
- missing the **grammatical gender/article** at the point of discovery,
- inconsistent about whether they show the **base form (lemma)** vs the **inflected form**,
- not optimized for **type-ahead** and fast selection.

2) **Deep-dive friction:** After getting a translation, learners must open additional sources to answer the real learning questions:
- “What’s the **article** and **plural**?”
- “Why is it **dem Hund / den Hund / des Hundes**?”
- “Is this noun weak/strong? What patterns apply?”
This forces context-switching across multiple tools (translator + dictionary + grammar page), breaking flow.

**V1 problem to solve:**  
Provide a **single, instant “search-to-deep-dive” lookup** where partial typing yields **article + full word + English meaning**, and selecting a result immediately explains the **core inflections and case forms**—so the learner can move from “I saw this word” → “I understand how to use it” without leaving the app.
